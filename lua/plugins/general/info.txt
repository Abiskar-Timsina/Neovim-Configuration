GENERAL PURPOSE PLUGINS
================================================================================

This directory contains plugins that enhance core Neovim functionality for
general-purpose editing and navigation tasks. These plugins are essential
for day-to-day editing workflows.

PLUGINS IN THIS DIRECTORY:
---------------------------

1. which-key.nvim
   Purpose: Keybinding discovery and help system
   Role: Displays a popup menu showing available keybindings when you press
         a prefix key (like <leader>). This is crucial for discovering and
         remembering custom keybindings without memorizing them all.
   Why Required: Without this, users would need to remember all custom
                 keybindings or constantly refer to documentation. It makes
                 the configuration self-documenting and user-friendly.

2. telescope.nvim
   Purpose: Fuzzy finder and unified search interface
   Role: Provides a powerful, extensible fuzzy finder for files, text search,
         symbols, and more. It's the primary way to navigate files and search
         content in this configuration.
   Why Required: Essential for modern Neovim workflows. Replaces multiple
                 commands with a unified, fast, and extensible interface.
                 Used for finding files, searching text, browsing symbols,
                 and accessing recent files.

3. telescope-ui-select.nvim
   Purpose: Telescope integration with vim.ui.select
   Role: Makes LSP actions (code actions, rename, etc.) use Telescope's
         interface instead of the default vim.ui.select menu, providing a
         consistent and better user experience.
   Why Required: Provides a better UI for LSP actions compared to the default
                 vim.ui.select, making the editor more cohesive.

4. nvim-tree.lua
   Purpose: File tree explorer
   Role: Provides a sidebar file tree for browsing and opening files. Replaces
         netrw (Neovim's built-in file explorer) with a more feature-rich
         and performant alternative.
   Why Required: Essential for navigating project structure, especially in
                 large codebases. Provides better integration with the Neovim
                 ecosystem compared to netrw.

HOW IT FITS IN THE GRAND SCHEME:
---------------------------------

The general plugins form the foundation of the editing experience:
- which-key makes the configuration discoverable
- telescope provides fast navigation and search
- nvim-tree offers visual file browsing
- Together, they enable efficient file and content navigation

These plugins are loaded early (or lazily) and are used throughout editing
sessions. They don't depend on language-specific features and work with
any file type.
