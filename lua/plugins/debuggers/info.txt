DEBUGGER PLUGINS (DAP)
================================================================================

This directory contains plugins for the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), which
provides debugging capabilities similar to VS Code. DAP allows you to set
breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and debug applications
directly within Neovim.

PLUGINS IN THIS DIRECTORY:
---------------------------

1. nvim-dap (dap.lua)
   Purpose: Core DAP functionality
   Role: Provides the core debugging functionality using the Debug Adapter
         Protocol. It supports setting breakpoints, stepping through code,
         inspecting variables, evaluating expressions, and more. Works with
         language-specific debug adapters.
   Why Required: Essential for debugging applications. Without DAP, you'd need
                 to use external debuggers or print statements. DAP provides
                 a unified debugging interface that works across languages.

2. nvim-dap-ui (dap-ui.lua)
   Purpose: User interface for DAP
   Role: Provides a user interface for DAP debugging, displaying debugging
         information in panels showing variables, watches, breakpoints, and
         the call stack. The UI automatically opens when debugging starts and
         closes when debugging ends.
   Why Required: Makes debugging much more user-friendly. Without the UI, you'd
                 need to use commands for everything. The UI provides visual
                 feedback and makes it easy to inspect variables and navigate
                 the call stack.

3. nvim-dap-virtual-text (dap-virtual-text.lua)
   Purpose: Inline debug information display
   Role: Displays debugging information inline as virtual text next to your
         code. Shows variable values, function parameters, and other debug
         information without needing to open the DAP UI panels.
   Why Required: Provides quick access to debug information without opening
                 panels. Makes debugging more efficient by showing variable
                 values directly in the code, reducing the need to switch
                 between code and debug panels.

HOW IT FITS IN THE GRAND SCHEME:
---------------------------------

The debugger plugins provide comprehensive debugging capabilities:

1. nvim-dap provides the core debugging engine
2. nvim-dap-ui provides visual debugging interface
3. nvim-dap-virtual-text provides inline debug information

Together, these plugins create a complete debugging experience:
- Set breakpoints and step through code
- Inspect variables and evaluate expressions
- View call stack and navigate execution
- See variable values inline in the code
- Debug multiple languages with a unified interface

This is essential for development workflows, especially for complex applications
where debugging is necessary. The DAP protocol is language-agnostic, so the
same interface works for Go, PHP, Python, and other languages.

DEPENDENCIES:
-------------

- nvim-dap is the core plugin (must be loaded first)
- nvim-dap-ui depends on nvim-dap
- nvim-dap-virtual-text depends on nvim-dap
- Language-specific debug adapters must be installed via Mason

The configuration ensures proper loading order and integration between plugins.

NOTE:
-----

nvim-dap-virtual-text requires the correct Treesitter parser to be installed
for the language you're debugging, otherwise virtual text won't appear.
