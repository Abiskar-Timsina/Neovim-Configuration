PROGRAMMING SUPPORT PLUGINS
================================================================================

This directory contains plugins that enhance the programming experience with
advanced syntax highlighting, code analysis, and development workflow features.
These plugins are essential for understanding and working with code effectively.

PLUGINS IN THIS DIRECTORY:
---------------------------

1. nvim-treesitter (treesitter.lua)
   Purpose: Advanced syntax highlighting and code analysis
   Role: Provides advanced syntax highlighting, code folding, and code analysis
         using incremental parsing. It's much more accurate than regex-based
         highlighting and provides better understanding of code structure.
         Enables features like syntax-aware text objects, better indentation,
         and code navigation.
   Why Required: Essential for modern Neovim development. Treesitter provides
                 accurate syntax highlighting that understands code structure,
                 not just patterns. It enables many advanced features like
                 syntax-aware selection, better folding, and improved code
                 navigation. Without Treesitter, Neovim would use basic regex
                 highlighting which is less accurate and less powerful.

2. todo-comments.nvim (todo-highlight.lua)
   Purpose: TODO comment highlighting and tracking
   Role: Highlights TODO, FIXME, NOTE, and other comment keywords in your code.
         Makes it easy to find and track todos, bugs, and notes throughout
         your codebase. Also provides search functionality to find all todos
         across files.
   Why Required: Helps track work items, bugs, and notes directly in code.
                 Makes it easy to find todos and fixme comments across a
                 codebase. Improves code organization and project management
                 by making todos visible and searchable.

HOW IT FITS IN THE GRAND SCHEME:
---------------------------------

The programming plugins enhance code understanding and workflow:

- Treesitter provides accurate syntax highlighting and code understanding
- todo-comments helps track work items and notes in code

Together, these plugins:
- Make code more readable with accurate syntax highlighting
- Enable advanced code navigation and manipulation
- Help track todos and work items
- Improve overall code understanding

Treesitter is particularly important as it enables many other features:
- Better indentation
- Syntax-aware text objects
- Improved code folding
- Better integration with LSP
- More accurate highlighting

LOADING STRATEGY:
----------------

- Treesitter loads early (lazy = false) as it's needed for syntax highlighting
- todo-comments loads on startup (VimEnter event) to highlight todos immediately
- This ensures syntax highlighting is available from the start

DEPENDENCIES:
-------------

- Treesitter requires language parsers to be installed (done automatically)
- todo-comments depends on plenary.nvim for search functionality
- Both plugins work independently but complement each other
