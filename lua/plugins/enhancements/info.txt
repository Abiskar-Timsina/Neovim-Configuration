ENHANCEMENT PLUGINS
================================================================================

This directory contains quality-of-life enhancement plugins that improve the
editing experience with additional features beyond core functionality. These
plugins add convenience features that make editing more efficient and enjoyable.

PLUGINS IN THIS DIRECTORY:
---------------------------

1. flash.nvim
   Purpose: Smart jump navigation
   Role: Provides intelligent jump navigation by highlighting potential jump
         targets and allowing quick navigation to them. Similar to vim-sneak
         or EasyMotion but more modern and integrated with Neovim's LSP features.
   Why Required: Makes navigation faster and more efficient. Instead of
                 multiple keystrokes to move to a location, flash allows
                 quick jumps with visual feedback. Especially useful for
                 navigating large files or jumping to specific words.

2. nvterm (floating-terminal.lua)
   Purpose: Integrated floating terminal
   Role: Provides a floating terminal integrated into Neovim. Allows running
         shell commands, build scripts, and other terminal operations without
         leaving the editor. The terminal can be toggled on/off and supports
         multiple terminal types.
   Why Required: Essential for development workflows. Allows running commands,
                 tests, builds, and git operations without switching to an
                 external terminal. Improves workflow efficiency by keeping
                 everything in one place.

HOW IT FITS IN THE GRAND SCHEME:
---------------------------------

The enhancement plugins add convenience features:

- flash.nvim improves navigation efficiency
- nvterm provides integrated terminal access

These plugins enhance productivity by:
- Reducing the number of keystrokes needed for navigation
- Eliminating the need to switch between editor and terminal
- Providing visual feedback for better user experience
- Making common tasks faster and more intuitive

While not strictly necessary, these plugins significantly improve the
editing experience and are considered essential for modern Neovim workflows.

LOADING STRATEGY:
----------------

Both plugins load lazily (VeryLazy event) to improve startup time:
- flash.nvim loads when needed (navigation feature)
- nvterm loads when needed (terminal feature)

This ensures fast startup while maintaining all functionality.
