DEVELOPMENT TOOLS PLUGINS
================================================================================

This directory contains plugins that form the core of the modern Neovim
development experience. These tools provide Language Server Protocol (LSP)
support, autocompletion, formatting, and linting capabilities.

PLUGINS IN THIS DIRECTORY:
---------------------------

1. mason.nvim
   Purpose: Portable package manager for Neovim development tools
   Role: Installs and manages LSP servers, DAP adapters, linters, formatters,
         and other development tools. It eliminates the need to manually install
         these tools system-wide, making the setup portable and isolated.
   Why Required: Without Mason, you'd need to manually install each LSP server,
                 formatter, and linter for each language. Mason automates this
                 and keeps everything in a Neovim-specific directory.

2. mason-lspconfig.nvim
   Purpose: Bridge between Mason and nvim-lspconfig
   Role: Connects Mason (the installer) with nvim-lspconfig (the LSP client).
         Provides the `ensure_installed` feature to automatically install LSP
         servers via Mason.
   Why Required: Simplifies LSP setup by automatically installing required
                 language servers. Without this, you'd need to manually install
                 each server and configure them separately.

3. nvim-lspconfig
   Purpose: Configure Neovim's built-in LSP client
   Role: Configures Neovim's native LSP client to work with language servers.
         Provides features like code completion, go to definition, hover docs,
         diagnostics, code actions, and refactoring.
   Why Required: LSP is the standard protocol for language-aware editing features.
                 This plugin is essential for modern development workflows,
                 providing IDE-like features in Neovim.

4. none-ls.nvim (formerly null-ls)
   Purpose: Bridge standalone formatters/linters with LSP
   Role: Wraps command-line formatters and linters as pseudo-LSP servers, allowing
         them to integrate seamlessly with Neovim's LSP features like
         auto-formatting on save and inline diagnostics.
   Why Required: Many formatters and linters aren't LSP servers. None-ls makes
                 them work with LSP features, providing a unified interface for
                 formatting and linting across languages.

5. nvim-cmp (autocompletion)
   Purpose: Completion engine for Neovim
   Role: Provides intelligent autocompletion from various sources (LSP, snippets,
         buffers, etc.). It's the completion engine that displays suggestions
         as you type.
   Why Required: Essential for productive coding. Provides code completion,
                 reducing typing and errors. Works with LSP to provide intelligent
                 suggestions based on code context.

6. LuaSnip
   Purpose: Snippet engine
   Role: Provides snippet support, allowing expansion of code templates. Works
         with nvim-cmp to provide snippet completion.
   Why Required: Snippets significantly speed up coding by allowing quick
                 insertion of code templates. Essential for efficient development.

HOW IT FITS IN THE GRAND SCHEME:
---------------------------------

The tools directory provides the core development infrastructure:

1. Mason installs all the tools (LSPs, formatters, etc.)
2. mason-lspconfig ensures LSP servers are installed
3. nvim-lspconfig configures the LSP client
4. none-ls integrates formatters/linters with LSP
5. nvim-cmp provides autocompletion
6. LuaSnip provides snippet support

Together, these plugins create a complete IDE-like experience:
- Code completion and suggestions
- Error and warning diagnostics
- Code formatting
- Go to definition, references, etc.
- Code actions and refactoring

This is the most critical directory for the development workflow. Without these
plugins, Neovim would be a basic text editor. With them, it becomes a powerful
development environment.

DEPENDENCIES:
-------------

- Mason must be installed first (it installs the tools)
- nvim-lspconfig depends on Mason for server installation
- nvim-cmp depends on nvim-lspconfig for LSP completion
- none-ls works alongside nvim-lspconfig for formatting/linting

The configuration ensures proper loading order and dependencies.
