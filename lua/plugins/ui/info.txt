UI ENHANCEMENT PLUGINS
================================================================================

This directory contains plugins that enhance the visual appearance and user
interface of Neovim. These plugins improve aesthetics, provide visual feedback,
and make the editor more pleasant to use.

PLUGINS IN THIS DIRECTORY:
---------------------------

1. lualine.nvim (status-bar.lua)
   Purpose: Customizable statusline
   Role: Displays a statusline at the bottom of each window showing useful
         information like current mode, file name, git status, LSP diagnostics,
         cursor position, and more. Provides visual feedback about editor state.
   Why Required: The default Neovim statusline is minimal. Lualine provides a
                 modern, informative statusline that helps users understand
                 the current context (file, mode, git status, errors, etc.).

2. bufferline.nvim (buffer.lua)
   Purpose: Tab-like buffer management interface
   Role: Displays open buffers as tabs at the top of the editor, making it
         easy to see and switch between open files. Integrates with LSP to
         show diagnostics (errors/warnings) on buffer tabs.
   Why Required: Without this, it's hard to see which files are open and
                 navigate between them. Bufferline provides a visual, tab-like
                 interface similar to modern editors, improving workflow.

3. mini.starter (start-screen.lua)
   Purpose: Custom startup screen
   Role: Provides a customizable start screen that appears when Neovim opens
         with no files. Can display quick actions, recent files, and custom
         commands. Replaces the default Neovim start screen.
   Why Required: Makes the editor more welcoming and provides quick access to
                 common actions. Improves the first-time user experience and
                 provides shortcuts to frequently used tasks.

4. catppuccin.nvim (themes/catppuccin.lua)
   Purpose: Modern colorscheme
   Role: Provides beautiful syntax highlighting and UI colors. Catppuccin is
         a popular, well-maintained colorscheme with multiple flavor options
         (latte, frappe, macchiato, mocha) and excellent plugin integration.
   Why Required: Good syntax highlighting is essential for code readability.
                 Catppuccin provides excellent contrast, multiple variants,
                 and integrates well with many Neovim plugins, ensuring a
                 cohesive visual experience.

HOW IT FITS IN THE GRAND SCHEME:
---------------------------------

The UI plugins enhance the visual experience:

- lualine provides information at a glance (statusline)
- bufferline shows open files visually (tabs)
- mini.starter provides a welcoming start screen
- catppuccin makes code beautiful and readable (colorscheme)

Together, these plugins create a modern, visually appealing editor that:
- Provides clear visual feedback
- Makes navigation intuitive
- Improves code readability
- Creates a cohesive, professional appearance

These plugins are primarily cosmetic but significantly impact user experience
and productivity. A well-designed UI reduces cognitive load and makes the
editor more pleasant to use.

LOADING STRATEGY:
----------------

- catppuccin loads early (priority = 1000) as colorscheme should be available
- Other UI plugins load lazily (VeryLazy event) to improve startup time
- This ensures fast startup while maintaining a polished UI
