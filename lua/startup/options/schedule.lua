-- vim.schedule() defers execution until the main event loop is running â€” basically, after Neovim has fully started and all plugins have loaded.

-- Setup clipboard between system and nvim, we need to schedule it as we need nvim to be fully ready before we setup the clipboard.
-- as it's an 'external' dependency.
-- See: `:help clipboard`
